This project is made for an homework
Honestly that's it it will just do matrix multipication.
First text area takes Vector1,
Second text area tekes Vector2,
Third is used to determine wheter it'll be inner or outer product, write "inner" or "outer"
Fourth determines how many times the multipication will be done enter a number (too big outer products will take long)
